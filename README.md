#                                                Background-subtraction
## MOTIVTION
To learn and implement different Backgroound-subtraction method's and understand the concept of Gaussian probability distribution function
## AIM
To implement different background-subtraction method's and also to implement the resarch paper based on  Adpative background-Mixture Modal for real time tracking 
## OVERVIEW
Background subtraction is a major preprocessing steps in many vision based applications. For example, consider the cases like visitor counter where a static camera takes the number of visitors entering or leaving the room, or a traffic camera extracting information about the vehicles etc.

## Background Subtraction Methods:
During this project we perform different methods for subtracting background and foreground form the frame of video 
For this we have used python, opencv and numpy module( matrix operation) 

### 1) Frame Differencing
### 2) Mean 
### 3) Median 
### 4) Median Approximation
### 5) Running Gaussian/single gaussian
### 6) Gaussian Mixture Model



## APPLICATIONS:
Background modeling and background subtraction algorithms are very commonly used in vehicle detection systems.
